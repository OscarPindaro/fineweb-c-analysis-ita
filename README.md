I extracted some keywrods with tf-idf. 
I also created a classification pipeline with haystack. Next time i will have tocreate some few-shot examples, probably wrap evrything inside a haystack component that does this ..vvv

Found a bug in the generation, now it works fine.
Next time do the visualization.
I was thinking to create an embedding like this:
x: embedding of the text
y: embedding of the category
z: x+y -> so in the plot samples with similar category are closer

Probably I'll export with plotly for the blog
